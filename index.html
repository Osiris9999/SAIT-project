            -<p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated
                species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to
                distinguish it
                from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or
                feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for
                companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
                registries.

                The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell
                are
                well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                growling,
                and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a
                solitary
                hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too
                faint or
                too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It also
                secretes and perceives pheromones.

                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from
                two
                to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known
                as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their
                proliferation
                and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
                extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.

                It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around
                3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication
                occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.

                As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. As of
                2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats
                owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26%
                of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. </p>
